Lab 1 Lisa Implementation 

1. Implement LISA processing engine as a stand-alone program to perform the 
   algorithm verification based on the testing patterns. The LISA algorithm
   should be able to realize sync extraction from the testing patterns with 
   1 byte, 2 bytes, ..., 32 bytes mataching capability. The payload of the 
   data is your_first_name+4_digits_SID

2. Testing patterns for the LISA processing engine are two types:
   (1) predefined sync field and provided to the class, e.g., the pattern looks 
       like the following: 
   
  0x50 0x51 0x52 0x53 0x54 0x55 0x56 0x57 0x58 0x59 0x5a 0x5b 0x5c 0x5d 0x5e 0x5f
  0xa0 0xa1 0xa2 0xa3 0xa4 0xa5 0xa6 0xa7 0xa8 0xa9 0xaa 0xab 0xac 0xad 0xae 0xaf

  and 

  0xc0 0x53 0x52 0x53 0x54 0x55 0x56 0x5f 0x58 0x09 0x5a 0x5b 0x5c 0x5d 0x5e 0x5f
  0x00 0xa1 0xaf 0xa3 0xf4 0xa5 0xa6 0xa7 0xa8 0xa9 0xaa 0xab 0xac 0xad 0xbe 0xaa

   (2) use rand() function to generate a two digits random hex number, then perform 
       XOR with the the predefined pattern to conduct test. A good implementation 
       should be able to extract the sync pattern. 


3. Implement wired debugging circuit, and then perform the communication test, 
   bo demonstrate the following data can be correnctly retrived with 1K buffer 
   implementation, with arbitrary starting location of the sync filed in the 1K
   buffer, the test data in 1K buffer format: 
 
   arbitrary_length_bits + sync_field(32_bytes) + your_first_name + 4_digits_SID
 
4. Repeat test in 3, but with wireless communication. 

5. The communication protocole for node N_i and N_j are defined as follows: 
   
   N_i starts communication with the message defined in 3 (and 4); 
   N_j continues reading to fill in 1K buffer, and once 1K buffer is filled 
       N_j starts decoding;
   N_j once decoding successfully, it sends ACK and self identification message
       as the same test pattern in 3 (and 4); 
   N_i performs continued reading to fill in 1K buffer, and once 1K buffer is 
       filled N_j starts decoding. 

6. Write a IEEE style report and perform in class individual demo with both report
   and demo board.
